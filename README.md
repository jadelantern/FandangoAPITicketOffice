# ImdbAPITicketOffice

Creating a demo ticket office that interfaces and grabs information for use in the project from Fandango's API

## Expectations
Before starting this project I had these expectations:

• To expand my knowledge on creating and working with API's.

• To gain more knowledge making API calls, and gathering information needed for the current project/task.

• To gain more knowledge on the use of API's in general.

• To gain more knowledge creating and working with web applications.

## Addressing Expectations

Upon creation of this project, I learned:

• How to better create methods, and better understanding of using a method to proform a single task making the app faster overall.

• How to interface with a web API, and pull requested information.

•  Gained more practice working with JSON.
